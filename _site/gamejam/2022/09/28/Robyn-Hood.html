This was the work of a team of 3. The game reimagines the legendary Robin Hood as a woman, and the player is her spirit guardian. It is the player’s task to cast spells to assit Robyn with her thievery. The player always has access to three basic spells: Go, Wait, and Retry. As the player goes through the level, the player can pick up stone spells for destroying obstacles and distracting enemies, a gust spell that can be used to displace the player and enemies, and a smoke spell for blinding enemies. The player must use these spells to help Robyn sneak past enemies. download on itch.io view source code on github Credits: Mick Cooke – MakeFire Music - Music and Sound Effects Thanos Gramosis - Art Noam Zeise - Programming" />

The player always has access to three basic spells: Go, Wait, and Retry.
