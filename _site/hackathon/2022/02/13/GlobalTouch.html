A python app with a database, made in 48 hours for Do you Have The Guts 2022

The app used google cloud for hosting an SQL server, and tkinter for the GUI as well as some web apis to fetch the weather and news. I was mainly responsible for the GUI and it was my first time using tkinter.</p>

<p>The app allows employees working as part of an international team to see what the weather and news is like in their co-worker’s countries. Employees can also share what is interesting them, as well as any homepages they use frequently for getting their local news.</p>
