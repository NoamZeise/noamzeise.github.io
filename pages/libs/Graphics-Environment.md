[Project Repository](https://github.com/NoamZeise/Graphics-Environment)

This project is a library for making apps that need hardware accelerated rendering, such as games.
There are two rendering backends, Vulkan and OpenGL. The library handles window creation, input, resource loading and management, and 2D/3D rendering. Currently it supports windows and linux.

The purpose of this library is for self-education. It allows me to learn about rendering, and implementing the same features in Vulkan and OpenGL helps me to see how different apis work.

Here are some projects using this library:

* [Reforestation - 3D Board Game](/gamejam/2023/07/10/Reforestation.html)
* [Robyn Hood - 2D Stealth Card Game](/gamejam/2022/09/28/Robyn-Hood.html)
* [Trials of the Pharaoh - 2D puzzle game](/gamejam/2022/05/30/TrialsOfThePharaoh.html)

older examples (vulkan only):
* [The Last Dodo - 2D Platformer](/gamejam/2022/03/22/The-Last-Dodo.html)
* [Get Back Jaxx - 2D Adventure](/gamejam/2022/02/02/Get-Back-Jaxx.html)
