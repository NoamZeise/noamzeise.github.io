I'm an undergraduate student studying Maths and Computer Science.
Programming is my main hobby, specifically in the areas of graphics, games and game engines. 
I like making libraries and using them during game jams. I also like playing games,
favorites include zachtronic games, the witness, in other waters, 
supergiant's games and platinum games.

At the moment I am working on a [framework for game jams](https://github.com/NoamZeise/Graphics-Environment), as well as learning common lisp.
