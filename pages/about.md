This is a blog where I put anything I work on, or anything I've learnt and might need to remember again in the future.

I'm an undergraduate student studying Maths and Computer Science.
I enjoy programming and usually focus on the areas of graphics, games, and game engines. 

This website is built with the static site generator [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on
github pages. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/NoamZeise/pages).
