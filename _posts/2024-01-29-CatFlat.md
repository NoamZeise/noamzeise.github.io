A game about frying fish for a hungry cat. Made in 48 hours for global game jam 2024 using my [Graphics-Environment](https://github.com/NoamZeise/Graphics-Environment) library built using C++ on vulkan and opengl.

Aim to cook as much fish as you can before the timer runs out! Once a fish has been cooked all the way through it will turn yellow, leaving it to rest will grant more time to cook.
The longer the fish cook the more points received

### Implementation Details

The game uses a light warp effect on the screen applied to the final rendered image, you can increase this with the plus and minus buttons. It distorts the uv coordinates of the final texture by a function of sine and cosine to get a periodic distortion. Many objects in the game are also squashed and squished by a scaling matrix with a periodic size to give the game a "bouncy" feel.


The pan and fish are all modelled as lines with an arbitrary rotation, so collision is easy to test.
