For [ProcJam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/procjam), a game jam about making a game that uses procedural generation. This room infinitely generates rooms as the player moves around, each room has a random number of exits. The room layout and spawns are chosen from a list of 23, and is rotated randomly by 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees. The game uses a relatively constant amount of memory, as it unloads far away rooms, and loads new ones in as you navigate the world.
