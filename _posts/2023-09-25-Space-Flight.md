## Unfinished Post

This is a 3D flight sim set in a solar system. Lost ship logs litter the system, rewarding exploration. The game uses Vulkan or OpenGL for rendering.

Here I go over a lot of the 3D maths involved in creating a space sim.
This includes getting directions from world space to screen space and 
quaternion rotation for 6DOF ship movement. This is my second 3D game,
and I feel I've learned a lot over the past week.

# Jam Details

GBJam (GameBoy jam) is a week-long game jam with the restriction of having the same resolution as a Gameboy (160Ã—144) and using only 4 colours at once. The game must also use the same input system (dpad + A + B + start + select). 

To illustrate what that looks like when playing on a gameboy, and to show the button layout, here is an image of a gameboy advance playing a gameboy game.

Because The game is made for playing on the computer, we are affored much more freedom as compared to developing for the original hardware. 
Firstly the   screen is much larger, and secondly we must map the computer's input to the limited input of a gameboy.

The jam itself had a secondary theme of space. I really played into this, making a 3D space flight sim taking place in a large solar system.

# Palettes

The rules of the gamejam allow 4 colours to be used on screen at once, but they don't have to match the actual colours of a Gameboy. The game's palette is the specific colours being used to draw the game. A goal of mine was to implement an easy palette swapping system. This would allow the look of the game to be changed at runtime, and for new palettes to be added without recompiling. Below you can see the results of this, The gif shows some of the game's preloaded palettes with the same scene in the background.

### 2D Vs. 3D

Because of the differences in the shaders for 2D and 3D rendering, I decided to limit the colours in different ways for each pipeline.

In 2D I limited all of the game's textures to 4 gray-scale colours, I could then render the textures as normal. The current palette is sent to the fragment shader and whichever of the 4 gray shades the fragment is, the colour can be swapped with the corresponding palette colour.

```glsl
int col = int(outColour.r * 100);
switch(col) {
case COLOUR0:
	outColour = palette.col0;
	break;
case COLOUR1:
	outColour = palette.col1;
	break;
case COLOUR2:
	outColour = palette.col2;
	break;
case COLOUR3:
	outColour = palette.col3;
	break;
}
```

In 3D I didn't want to limit the textures to four colours, and I wanted to use lighting, which usally produces many different shades. The approach I took here was to do everything as normal, then at the end of the fragment shader I calculate the intensity of the final colour. I use the intensity as a threshold value to choose one of the 4 colours from the palette.

```glsl
float intensity = (outColour.x + outColour.y + outColour.z) * 33;
if(intensity < COLOUR0)
	outColour = palette.col0;
else if(intensity < COLOUR1)
	outColour = palette.col1;
else if(intensity < COLOUR2)
	outColour = palette.col2;
else
	outColour = palette.col3;
```

# Solar System

The planets are shaded using blinn-phong shading, which is then limited to 4 colours.
The source of the light for everything is the sun, which I placed at the origin of the world to make the maths easier.
The planets are a 3D sphere with the model's texture swapped out to make different planets look distinct. Planets also have a custom rotation speed,
so that they slowly spin as you look at them, but the effect can be subtle. See below a very sped up gif of a planet and it's moon spiining.

# Ship Camera Controls Using Quaternions

Quaternions are mathematical objects that make combining 3D rotations easier.

The ship needed to be able to move along three rotational axes to be realistic. These directions are called pitch, yaw, and roll.

[Pic of pitch, yaw, roll diagram]


 The ship class inherits from my camera class. Previously my cameras have used Euler angles for pitch and yaw, which wouldn't work well with roll too. I needed to use quaternions (which are 4D vectors that help with rotation in 3D) to do pitch, yaw and roll without issues.
 
# Targeting 3D Objects in 2D

The game features a targeting system that makes navigating easier. The ship can target 3D poisitions in the world, which are shown in the ship's 2D overlay with circles around where that position is in the world. When that object is offscreen, there is an arrow pointing in the closest direction. 

[clip of targeting in action]

Because the ship is really just a 3D camera, the ship has access to the game's view and projection matricies. These matricies work by transforming points from our 3D world, first into a position relative to the camera (the view matrix), then a position when that point is 'projected' onto a 2D screen (the projection matrix). These matricies are normally used by the vertex shader to render the 3D models, but given that it can get use from a target in 3D space to a point on the screen, we can use this for the targeting system. So given a view-projection matrix and a target, we can get the distance of the target from the camera, and the screen coordinates of the target.

```C++
vec4 clip = viewProj * vec4(target.x, target.y, target.z, 1); // target with w-component 1 (as it is a position and not a vector)
vec2 screen(clip.x / clip.w, -clip.y / clip.w); // x, y screen coords of the target in the range [-1, 1]
float dist = clip.z; // distance from the camera
```

This gives us x and y values in the range of [-1, 1] for the position of that point on the screen. values above that indicate an offscreen target. Currently, if we were looking directly away from the target it would give us screen coordinates within [-1, 1] as well. This is because that point would be projected on the 'other side' of the screen. To fix this we can use the distance from the camera to the target, which we get for free with the z component of the target in projection space. With a negative distance we know that the target is behind the camera. We know that if the target is behind us, then it is definitely offscreen, even if the screen coords indicate otherwise. For this reason we can split the rendering of the target into two state, onscreen and offscreen. The onscreen rendering is simple.

```C++
if(fabs(screen.x) <= 1 && fabs(screen.y) <= 1 && dist > 0) { //if onscreen
	// use the onscreen circle sprite
	setTex(onscreen);
	// convert to range [0, 1]
	vec2 screenPos = vec2(screen.x + 1, screen.y + 1) / 2;
	// multiply by screen dimension
	screenPos *= vec2(GB_WIDTH, GB_HEIGHT);
	// then offset tex by half of it's dimensions to center it
	screenPos -= offscreen.tex.dim / 2;
	setPos(screenPos);
}
```

With the offscreen rendering we need to treat negative distance differently, and to keep the target cursor at the border of the screen even if the screen position is within [-1, 1]. We also need to rotate the sprite so the arrow points in the right direction. When the camera is pointing around 90 degrees away from the target, values for the screen clip coordinates get very large. This can lead to visual issues with the target when the camera is moving around. To fix, we can clamp the larger coordinate to a magnitude of 1 and correct the other coordinate based off this, making it much smoother. Because one of the clip coordinates are clamped to -1 or 1, we automatically have the target at the edge of the screen at all times. We can think of corrected coordinate gives a vector pointing from the middle of the screen out to the edge. Working out the angle of this vector in relation to a vector pointing up from the middle gives us a rotation value to use for the arrow sprite.

```C++
else {
	//use the offscreen arrow sprite (pointing up)
	setTex(offscreen); 
	
	// fix the magnitude of the larger position to 1 or -1
	// and correct the other direction accordingly
	float* fixed = &screen.y;
	float *variable = &screen.x;
	if(fabs(screen.x) > fabs(screen.y)) {
		fixed = &screen.x;
		variable = &screen.y;
	}
	if(*fixed != 0) {
		*variable /= fabs(*fixed); 
		*fixed = sign(fixed); 
	}
	
	// get the angle of the vector pointing towards the target
	// from the center of the screen
	vec2 norm = normalize(screen);
	// offset angle by 90, as the texture is pointing up
	float angle = atan2(norm.y, norm.x) + (PI / 2);
	
	// set texture rotation
	setBaseRot(angle * 180 / PI); //convert to degrees
	// limit screen pos to [0, 1] then multiply by screen dimensions
	vec2 texPos(
		((screen.x + 1) / 2) * GB_WIDTH,
		((screen.y + 1) / 2) * GB_HEIGHT);
	// clamp to the border of the screen
	if(texPos.x > GB_WIDTH - offscreen.dim.x)
	    texPos.x = GB_WIDTH - offscreen.dim.x;
	if(texPos.y > GB_HEIGHT - offscreen.dim.y)
	    texPos.y = GB_HEIGHT - offscreen.dim.y;
	setPos(texPos);
}
```

With that working for a single target, it becomes trivial to add for multiple targets when it is abstracted properly.
