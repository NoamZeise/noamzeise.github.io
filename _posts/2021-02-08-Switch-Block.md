Switch Block is a platformer with a very restricted resolution of 84×48 
and a palette of two colours. 
<!-- more -->
The game has normal move and jump controls, but revolves around the mechanic of “switching” blocks,
where blocks are turned on and off with a set pace. 
The levels get progressively harder until the platforming becomes very tight.
