You run a deli shop, where you sell sandwiches, but you specialise in fully customisable orders. Customers ask for whatever they please, be that a bread sandwich or a quintuple tomato stack. Your customers are not only particular, they are also quite impatient. If you take too long to fulfill their order, they will take off and give your business a purr review. So make sure to keep them happy!


If you have any ingredients that you don't want, feed them to the cat on the very left, he's always hungry!
