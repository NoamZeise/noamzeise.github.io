A Physics Based game about hitting coins with the cursor, causing them to bounce through a level. The game Includes a few levels, a level editor, and a toy environment for playing with the physics.

Made using C# and the Monogame framework in a week for [Monogamejam3](https://itch.io/jam/monogamejam-3)

All of the physics objects within the game are circular, so collision and reflection is easier to handle as compared to polygonal physics objects. The circles interact with each other and rectangular colliders, reflecting their velocity based on the angle they strike eachother.
