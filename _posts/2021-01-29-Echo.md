Echo is a stealth game where the exact location of enemies is not known, 
instead they leave behind echos at the location they were in.

You must work out their movement and try to avoid them.

Some parts of the map are hidden unless your torch reveals it, this can make navigation tricky, the torch range can be extened with shift, but this will make you more likely to alert enemies.

Made for the Blackthornprod #3 game jam over the course of a week.
