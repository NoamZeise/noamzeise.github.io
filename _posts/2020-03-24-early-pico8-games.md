1. Heart Score 2020-03-22

My first pico-8 game. A simple, endless high-score game about collecting pellets without letting them expire.

2. Cake Jump 2020-03-25

A platforming game. pico-8 has a very limited amount of space for levels, so this platformer only has one. The game times your progress and keeps track of a high score.

3. Space Shoot 2020-03-31

A bullet hell. Spaceship with a gun, you have three lives and three bombs to manage enemies with. Enemies physically degrade as they take damage.
