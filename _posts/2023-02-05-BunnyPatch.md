Protect your carrot patch from encroaching weeds.

Made with my [rust game library](https://github.com/NoamZeise/sdl2-rs-game-template) in 48 hours for [global game jam 2023](https://globalgamejam.org/2023/games/bunnypatch-0).

Click next turn to advance time by a few step, and you can watch as the game world changes. When the carrots sparkle, it means they have been harvested and added to your carrot bank in the top right. You can click on the button in the top left to open the shop and buy tiles that interact with the world in some way.
